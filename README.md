#  Biodiversity Explorer
 Biodiversity Explorer is a Vite‑powered React + TypeScript application that showcases endangered species in a responsive, lazy‑loaded masonry grid using react-photo-album and react-lazy-load-image-component for optimal performance  Nx Devtools DEV Community . It retrieves real‑time observations from the iNaturalist API via Axios, with a custom service transforming JSON into typed Species entities  iNaturalist GitHub . The UI offers pill‑style filters built with Material UI’s ToggleButtonGroup, letting users multi‑select by region, habitat, or threat‑level and instantly reshuffle the gallery  MUI . Micro‑interactions—hover‑scale effects on cards and slide‑in detail panels—are driven by Framer Motion for smooth, spring‑based animations  Motion . Finally, headless virtualization with @tanstack/react-virtual powers infinite scrolling, rendering only visible cards to maintain 60 FPS fluidity even with large datasets
